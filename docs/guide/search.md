### Easy Guide to Using Search

Our platform has a smart search tool to help you quickly find exhibitors, booths, and other things.

#### How Search Results Are Ordered

The search shows you the best matches first:

1.  **Perfect Name Match:** Items with names that exactly match your search.
2.  **Close Name Match:** If there's no perfect match, it shows similar names (even with small spelling mistakes).
3.  **Description Match:** Finally, it shows items where your search words are in the description.

This helps you see the most relevant results immediately.

#### Search Features

**1. Highlighted Results**

Your search words are highlighted in the results. This makes it easy to quickly see why something was found.
